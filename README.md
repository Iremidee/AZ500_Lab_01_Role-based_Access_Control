# AZ500_Lab_01_Role-based_Access_Control
This project demonstrate the process of implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure by creating Azure users and groups, as well as assigning roles to groups to manage access permissions effectively. I managed user access through different methods, including the Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.
