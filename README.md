# AZ500_Lab_01_Role-based_Access_Control
## Role-Based Access Control Architecture Diagram


## Lab objectives
* Exercise 1: Create the Senior Admins group with the user account Joseph Price as its member (the Azure portal).
* Exercise 2: Create the Junior Admins group with the user account Isabel Garcia as its member (PowerShell).
* Exercise 3: Create the Service Desk group with the user Dylan Williams as its member (Azure CLI).
* Exercise 4: Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.
## Lab scenario
I showed a proof of concept on how Azure users and groups are created. Also, how role-based access control is used to assign roles to groups. 
* Created a Senior Admins group containing the user account of Joseph Price as its member
* Created a Junior Admins group containing the user account of Isabel Garcia as its member.
* Created a Service Desk group containing the user account of Dylan Williams as its member.
* Assigned the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.

For all the resources in this lab, I used the East US region. 
## Summary
This project demonstrate the process of implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure by creating Azure users and groups, as well as assigning roles to groups to manage access permissions effectively. 

I managed user access through different methods, including the Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.
## Documentation
* I used the official Azure documentation
