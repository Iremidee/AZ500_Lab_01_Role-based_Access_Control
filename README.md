# AZ500_Lab_01_Role-based_Access_Control
This project demonstrate the process of implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure by creating Azure users and groups, as well as assigning roles to groups to manage access permissions effectively. 

I managed user access through different methods, including the Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.
## Lab objectives
* Exercise 1: Create the Senior Admins group with the user account Joseph Price as its member (the Azure portal).
* Exercise 2: Create the Junior Admins group with the user account Isabel Garcia as its member (PowerShell).
* Exercise 3: Create the Service Desk group with the user Dylan Williams as its member (Azure CLI).
* Exercise 4: Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.
## Lab scenario
You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how Azure users and groups are created. Also, how role-based access control is used to assign roles to groups. Specifically, you need to:
* Create a Senior Admins group containing the user account of Joseph Price as its member
* Create a Junior Admins group containing the user account of Isabel Garcia as its member.
* Create a Service Desk group containing the user account of Dylan Williams as its member.
* Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.

For all the resources in this lab, we are using the East US region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.
